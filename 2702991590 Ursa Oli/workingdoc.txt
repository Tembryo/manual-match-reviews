Ranked AP, Party

1 Pos farmer, decent matchups: Should outscale, similar teamfight strength. 

STarting items: lots of regen, decent vs Tide

Consider staying in side jungle to protect from wards, if support places no laneward

Could start creepblock earlier, just ran in front for 5seconds from 019

112 missed lasthit (too early)

can denie one melee creep

129 missed lasthit (denied, no chance, prehit to get fury swipe stacks or use Overpower)
136 missed lasthit (denied, walked too far back)
144 missed lasthit (stood too far, late because big creepwave kills too fast)

154 standing in lane  - could have blocked creeps a bit

buy boots
216 good harass

219 could start denying creep, instead pushed
226 missed deny

233 checked tidehunter

239 missed deny

255 missed lasthit (too late, need to use overpower/earthshock)

357 missed lasthit (stood too far)

400 check scoreboard

410 missed lasthit (used earth shock too late)

413 !! missed solokill on Tidehunter
    - give off Tower aggro at 413
    - keep chasing as have boots
    - kill in  3 hits, have big creepwave
    slight danger of earthshaker porting in, but should be OK 

442 missed lasthit (too early, 1 hp!)
454 missed deny (too late)
    go to shop
        501 missed deny (backed off to go to shop)
        should have lost another lasthit, if tide denies

505 missed opportunity to eat tango

505 missed lasthit (canceled attack)
521 missed deny (too early)

526 missed opportunity to eat 2nd tango

602 missed deny (went to shop)

610-618 fight
    solokill on tidehunter

623 missed opportunity to eat tango

631 should not tank creepwave
    - tide respawns quickly, rather pull the lane back

638 fight ganked by axe
    !! - could run to the right to escape

Tabbed out during death - check what is going on in the other lanes

741 missed lasthit (too late - or could have used spell)
747 bad camera placement - keep it more forward
758 missed lasthit (hit other creep/moved away)
!missed opportunity to push - should kill ranged creep quickly/nuke wave with Earthshock
808 missed lasthit (too late)

should be eating tangoes
939 missed opportunity to push - should kill ranged creep quickly

958 no need to denie creep, rather keep it and push (loses ranged creep)
1007 didnt check tide+axe  walking into lane
    - didnt see axe blink dagger
1018 missed opportunity to check tide
1020 didnt check necrophos walking into lane
    - didnt see dagon on necrophos
fight 1125 - 
    - missed opportunity to escape by casting Enrage at 1128
        tide running in, saw Necrophos earlier

1230 checked hardcamp - saw tide farming

fight 1240- gank on tide
    -clicked too much, clicked oracle - walking away and missing an attack

13:00 missed lasthit (too early)

1302 2 unnecessary attacks on creep (dont attack the first one, creeps will hit it)
1311 missed lasthit (busy with last creep)

1340 check bottom
1343 TP bottom
    !! bad idea - 600 gold to blink
    ! own jungle is secured by wards, play top 
1348 didnt check axe 

1359 fight - gank on necrophos 
    !! bad initiation route, bad position 
    can easily wrap around from the side
    also secures the area, as scouts out the jungle (in this case, will find earthshaker)
    - could get out at 14:10. Not worth dying for a kill on earthshaker

1508 inefficient movement
    - hardcamp at secret shop is farmed by team, have to change rout
    - want to play top anyway, as need 900 gold to blink

1539 inefficient farming
    -missed earthshock, only hitting 1 of 3 creeps
    - unnecessary running back from camp, enough regen with VLadimirs
    - bad attack order, kill big wolf first 
    - inefficient earth shock, hit 3 targets with better attack order

1557 unnecessary hit on melee creep (focused by ranged creep)
    unnecessary hit on ranged creep (dies to earthshock)

1606 TP bottom 
    - bad tp
    - too far to contribute to fight
    - dont want to walk into a dangerous fight without blink dagger
    - move top instead and push - splitting up enemies

1707 Inefficient movement:
    walk back to base

    instead: eat tangoes, buy blink at sideshop, farm hardcamp, go for rosh!

1749 TP top to T2
    ! bad idea, centaur just died
    2 worst enemies up there -  earthshaker stuns, necrophos strong 
    could go rosh!

1817 didnt check earthshaker
    - would have seen his blink dagger

1826 could blink on earthshaker - better than running at him, also earlier initiation 

1943 inefficient farming
    - running away from creeps 

2010 inefficient movement
    - move to lanecreeps from harcamp, farm next wave as well
    - creates push top, can then TP bot - Rosh!
        [minimap]

    - camps on the way are farmed, dont want to walk that much

    use blink dagger to move! missed 2 blinks , =over medium camp trees =into ancients
        []
    2044 indecision, go for ancient camp straight away

2100
    inefficient, kill ancient camp before moving on

2106 go for gank on silencer
    ! bad idea, no vision
    2116 saw necrophos on the minimap nearby, didn't notice
    should walk through the side 
    fight

2226 TP mid
    - should be bottom T2 for rosh
    - no wards in mid, not too keen to take a fight

    fight

2258 inefficient movement
    go back to base
    - instead: farm kill hardcamp, maybe kill ancients, regen with lifesteal!

2310 use blink dagger to move faster
    especially out of fountain

2326 checked ppl moving, checked silencer, tide

2322 use blink to move

2354 fight
    engage from smoke on earthshaker
    !no vision at all
    !saw 3+ heroes move bot
    ! high likelihood that more are behind
    ! centaur and SF are far
    ! behind, dont want 5v5

2556 took rosh!

2614 missed lasthit

2625 inefficient farming
    - take the medium camp near rune instead, so allies can farm the central one
    - move on to smallcamp/hardcamp 
2627 inefficient movement
    -moved to courier
    - let it bring stuff instead

2638 TP to base to regen mana
    ! unnecessary, no need to immediately fill up
    ! supports have arcane boots (SK nearby)
    ! will join supports to defend 

2651 use blink dagger to move out of fountain

2706 inefficient movement
    ! immediately go for hardcamp
    !not your job as carry to be first defender

2731 inefficient movement
    blink over into ancient camp, farm it

2832 missed lasthit (too late)

2857 fight
    2905 earthshock only on one target 

3025 inefficient movement
    farm mediumcamp, smallcamp, harcamp instead of running and only killing hardcamp 
        !have ward

3032 inefficient farming
    missed earthshock, hit only 2/3 creeps in camp

3046 bad movement
    !no way to fight with 2 dead, way behind
    what happens: move mid to defend
    better: stay bottom to splitpush 
        maybe fight into earthshaker 

3046 inefficient movement
    use blink dagger to move!

3235 use blink dagger to move!
3255 inefficient farming 
    - use earthshock to farm

3315    fight
    dagger gets canceled by echo slam (end of range)
    !going back in, while SF is running

        bad target selection: 
        Tide used ravage, not strong
         deep in the fight, behind earthshaker - later blocked by fissure
        rather focus earthshaker (important kill, as low cooldowns)
    could use BKB to try and escape
    save unrelieable gold and buy basher

3527 passive play
    can walk up to T3 mid and hit
        - 3 dead, lots of damage with ursa+sf
    force glyph, or maybe take tower
    possibly even initiate

3627 missed lasthit (too early)

3726 inefficient movement - farm medium camp on the way out, use blink
    (optional: farm hardcamp before, risky)
3740 inefficient movement - use blink to move

3805 inficient movement - bad pathing
    blink up over cliff into easy camp
    dont move into lane with sf, rather go for hardcamp, move further up into lane

3840 fight
    use aegis
    - 3843 should precast overpower before running back in, save 4.5 sec cooldown
        3852 could back a little earlier, when SF's last attack is out
        3903 should recast overpower when stack runs out

3938 fight
    - have short window to cast Enrage, should be spamming it after initiation
    - see enemies on minimap before initiation
        - should be watching the minimap 
        - could have the camera on centaur who is scouting

4234 should recast overpower when buff runs out

4236 figth
    4252 missed earthshock

4347
    ! missed opportunity to push
    should go for some damage on T3, 2 dead, no ravage

4508 fight
    !! should use BKB and go in
    ! oracle ultimate up, want to go lifesteal
    ! want to dodge follow up spells
    ! team went in, should follow

4644 precast overpower before TP into fight
4648 unnecessary Enrage

4914 fight
    4933 bad target selection!
        go for tide/axe instead
        !wanto to get away from fountain/T4, rebuys
        ! towards T3s to push
        !blink over fissure is bad
