Match context: Party ranked AP.
Playing snowballing carry with good hero matchups - focus is on reaching core items quickly, to then put pressure and secure a strong advantage through kills. Got counterinitated in multiple dangerous initiations, having to play from behind most game.

Highlight tip:
Make sure to finish Blink Dagger before joining fights - don't actively rotate with TPs for uncertain ganks, rather stay in safe areas.

Summary:
= Good itembuild, important early BKB. Should finish Vladimir's Offering after buying Blink Dagger. 
= Efficiency improvements through better movement routes and using Blink Dagger to move faster. 
- Early ganking delayed item progression.
- Initiation into multiple dangerous fights.


Itemisation:

+ Lots of regen to lane against Tidehunter
+ Early Phase Boots
- Finished Vladimir's Offering:
    suggestion: Speed up the Blink Dagger by only buying Ring of Basilius and Mask of Death. 
+ Blink Dagger
+ BKB
+ Basher into Abyssal Blade


Early game:

After 10 Creepwaves (5:23): 21 lasthits, 5 denies
            Missed 17 lasthits, 5 denies

Frequent reasons for mising CS: 
    stood too far away 136 144 333 357
    Didnt prehit in tower 304 312 314 318 
    cancelled the attack 100 505
    hit too early 112 442

+ Clean kill on Tidehunter at 048

= Missed opportunities to pull lane back against Tidehunter 
    154 standing in lane  - could have blocked creeps a bit
    219 could start denying creep, instead pushed
    631 should not tank creepwave

= Missed opportunities to push empty lane 
    759 should kill ranged creep quickly/nuke wave with Earthshock
    939 should kill ranged creep quickly
    958 denied own creep, losing own ranged creep

- Missed a solokill on Tidehunter at 413
    Redirect tower aggro to creeps at 413
    Had a big creepwave and boots advantage

- Unnecessary death to a gank by Axe 638
    Didn't use tangoes to stay full health, opoportunities to use at 505 526 623
    Could escape the gank by escaping into the river instead of back up the lane.
    [minimap]



Information:

= Checked enemy inventories a few times
= Watched some distant action

- Missed enemies walking into own lane at 1007 1020
    - didn't check Axe to see Blink Dagger 1007
    - didn't check Necrophos to see Dagon 1020

- Missed checking enemy Earthshaker before initiating a gank 1817
    - would have seen his Blink Dagger

- Overall need more active camera to make good decisions

Mechanics:

+ Regular use of spells to farm

= Hits on low HP creeps, instead of evening out the HP to kill the group with Earthshock 1302 1539 1557 

= Suboptimal use of Earthshock:
    Didn't hit all creeps in neutral camp at 1539 3032
    missed enemy in fight at 2905 4252
    Didn't use it to farm at 3255

= Suboptimal movement:
    ran away from creeps 1539 1943
    indecision, waiting before farming 2044 2706
    left creepcamp without farming 2100

- Precast Overpower before walkink into fights 1357 3843 3903 4234 4644

- \important Use Blink Dagger to speed up movement. Unused at 2024 2040 2310 2322 2651 2731 3046 3235 3726
[x minimap for move 2010-2040]


Movement:

1508 inefficient movement towards bottom
    - hardcamp at secret shop is farmed by team, have to change route
    - want to play top anyway, as need 900 gold to blink

3726 farm medium camp on the way out, use blink
    (optional: farm hardcamp before, risky)

3805 bad pathing
    blink up over cliff into easy camp
    dont move into lane with sf, rather go for hardcamp, move further up into lane
    [x minimap]

Fight Execution:

- 1128 missed opportunity to live by casting Enrage 
    tide running in, saw Necrophos earlier

1359 fight - gank on Necrophos 
    - bad initiation route: instead wrap around from the side
        [minimap]
        scout the area, (in this case, will find earthshaker)
        better angle: force necrophos to move away from the tower
    - could get out at 14:10. Not worth dying for a kill on earthshaker

1826 could blink on earthshaker - better than running at him, also earlier initiation 

2106 gank on silencer
    - 2116 saw necrophos on the minimap nearby, didn't notice
    - should walk through the side, blink from the trees

3315  !going back in, while SF is running
    bad target selection: 
        Tide used ravage, not strong
         deep in the fight, behind earthshaker - later blocked by fissure
        rather focus earthshaker (important kill, as low cooldowns)
    could use BKB to try and escape
    save unrelieable gold and buy basher

3840 fight
        3852 could back a little earlier, when SF's last attack is out
        3903 should recast overpower when stack runs out

3938 fight
    - have short window to cast Enrage, should be spamming it after initiation
    - see enemies on minimap before initiation
        - should be watching the minimap 
        - could have the camera on centaur who is scouting

4508 fight
    !! should use BKB and go in
    ! oracle ultimate up, want to go lifesteal
    ! want to dodge follow up spells
    ! team went in, should follow

4914 fight
    4933 bad target selection!
        go for tide/axe instead
        !wanto to get away from fountain/T4, rebuys
        ! towards T3s to push
        !blink over fissure is bad

Strategic Decisions:

+ Farm safelane against Tide

- Stopped laning for ganks too early. Actively went for fights before buying Blink Dagger.
    1343 TP bottom
    !! bad idea - 600 gold to blink
    ! own jungle is secured by wards, play top 
    1359 fight - gank on necrophos 

    1606 TP bottom 
    - bad tp
    - too far to contribute to fight
    - dont want to walk into a dangerous fight without blink dagger
    - move top instead and push - splitting up enemies

- Did not go for early opportunities to take Roshan 
    1343 TP bottom to fight
    1749 TP top to fight
    2106 Go for gank on silencer
    2226 TP mid to fight

- Fighting into risky situations
    1359 gank on necrophos: No vision at all, enemies all missing 
    1749 fight into Necrophos/Earthshaker: Centaur just died, 2 worst enemies up there (earthshaker stuns, necrophos most farmed enemy) 
    2106 gank on silencer: no vision, Necrophos/Earthshaker missing for long time
    2226 conter-initiate in mid: no vision, all missing

- Taking bad fights: 
    2354 smokegank: 
        no vision, bad position
        only smoked with Ursa and Sand King.
        Uncover Earthshaker and Tidehunter, hard kills.
        highly likely for more behind

- Unnecessary return to fountain:
    1707 instead heal up with tangoes and lifesteal
        in this situation: eat tangoes, buy blink at sideshop, farm hardcamp, go for in this situation
    2314 heal up with lifesteal while farming jungle
    2638 supports with arcane boots (SK nearby)
        no need to immediately fill up, not looking to force a fight as weak and enemies are grouped.

Missed splitpush opportunities
    2010 - camps on the way are farmed, dont want to walk that much
        Instead:
        - move to lanecreeps from harcamp, farm next wave as well
        - creates push top, can then TP bot - Rosh!
            [x minimap]

    3046 no way to fight with 2 dead, way behind.
        [minimaps]

Missed opportunities for tower damage:
    3527 can walk up to T3 mid and hit
            - 3 dead, lots of damage with ursa+sf
        force glyph, or maybe take tower
        possibly even initiate
