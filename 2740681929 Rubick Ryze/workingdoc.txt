Match Context:
Professional game for Boston Major 2016 Qualifiers, Groupstage. Position 5 support Rubick. Focus is on warding and contributing to ganks and teamfights with spells. Had to play with small amout of farm as the game plays out relatively even, major contribution with stolen Eclipse in two teamfights, game is lost in a misplayed teamfight for Rosh.

Tips:
- Missed early Tango Usage: 151 719 (this one prevents death in a fight)
- Prioritise preventing sidepulls by the offlaner! Too far at 221 321
- Shift-queue ward placement and a follow-up movement when going only for wards. 1027 1443 1817 2331 3756 3838
- When time is no issue, drop Magic Stick (or at least one other item increasing Manapool) before using Arcane Boots 1359 1743 2605 3703
- Missed 26 lasthits to own creeps when pushing - prioritise lasthitting the creep that dies first to the own wave/ranged creep over getting slightly more push.
- Don't move close to the enemy core in Lategame fights, stay further out to cast spells. 4451 4706 4942


048 information : Missed Enchantress placing ward 
    Info shows super short - need a camera on the deep ward
    Info Batrider pings position, didnt infer that she placed ward from here -  Ogre rotates through later

114 execution : moved in too close for harass, drew agro on ranged creep, moved it to the pull

    + ideal outcome, getting the lasthit and solo exp on the creep for lvl2 (crucial for following kill)
    - risky, Nyx was able to deny 

151 missed opportunity to eat tango
    Info could eat the rosh tree at 2:03 , but maybe keep that for juking 
    - 150 HP missing - could use that later critical situation at 229

202 Delaying to take the rune until 213, time needed at 221!
    - Brood doesn't have bottle yet

221 Too far to prevent side pull
    - Have to walk into aggroed creeps, took ~170 damage
    - Lost 1 melee creep to neutral camp
    - Dangerous situation at 229: If Nyx anticipated the movement could die to impale, creeps, and Sun Strike.
    screenshot at 229

314 !important! missed lasthit in pull (hit wrong creep, ignoring ranged creeps target)
    - could buy a second Clarity with the additional gold at 4:04, to use after next fight at 5:05
316 Execution: Moved back unnecessarily far
    - Lose vision of the jungle, Enchantress is off the map, could be moving in

321 Far to prevent side pull 
    - Rely on passive play of Nyx: potentially dangerous situation at 331, could take lots of damage to impale+creepwave, sunstrike possible
    = Good outcome, get the creepwave back


416 !important! Bad camera placement: dont see nyx moving in
    screenshot of original cam vs good cam
    = Need to use Telekinesis to secure pull
    - Allows him to stun and draw creeps. Loses lane equilibrium, 4 creeps, death of Ogre in bad gank.

719 !important! Could use tango after reveal to regen for incoming fight
    = 13 seconds to regen until death, lives through hits and even a possible Lucent Beam (Raindrops come off cooldown).

925 Decision Decide to keep the lane back earlier
    - missed opportunity to deny melee creep 931 936
    - Unnecessary hit on enemy creep 935
    - Moves lane up a bit at 1002
940 Mechanics missed lasthit (too early)
1011 Mechanics missed lasthit (impatient to push, hit wrong creep)

1027 Efficiency: Didn't shift-queue movement after warding

1037 Efficiency: Unnecessary movement back towards jungle, losing ~10 seconds of movement time
    - See 3 heroes engaging, no way to fight
    = Could walk towards mid and push earlier (lose a ranged creep to tower later)
    ! Could move in an place aggressive ward while enemy team is distracted
        [minimap]


1132 Efficiency: Could use forge spirits to farm neutrals instead of moving them along (will be off cooldown for next fight)
    = Send them on the hard camp
    = Could use fade bolt and farm stacked medium camp (critical on Mana though, as low mana regen)


1150 Execution: Bad gank on Nyx, show to next creepwave
    = Can possibly catch with Storm Spirit, would kill with Telekinesis/Fade Bold/stolen Impale.

1200 Decision: Placed sentry ward in obvious, but useful position
    - Can place further up. With this, storm could get hit from Vendetta at 1219
    = Keep and place further up at 1212



1247 Mechanics missed lasthit (impatient, maybe attack creep in the back and lasthit the one focused by own creeps)
1248 Mechanics missed lasthit (impatient/ too early)
1317 Mechanics Missed lasthit (impatient/ mismicro on forgespirits)
1319 Mechanics Missed lasthit (impatient/ mismicro on forgespirits)
1344 Mechanics Missed lasthit on neutral (impatient/ mismicro on forgespirits)

1356 Itemisation: Missed opportunity to sell last tango, Missed opportunity to buy TP

1359 Mechanics: Didn't drop magic stick before using Arcanes 

1443 Mechanics: Hesitation, didn't shift queue movement after warding
    - !far from team afterwards

1652 Decision: Leave creepwave top
    = Could try to stay out of vision for Experience , risky with Nyx missing

1739 Mechanics Missed lasthit (impatient, hit one creep too much, didn't prehit ranged creep)

1743 Mechanics: Didn't drop Magic Stick before using arcanes

1746 Information: Delivered wards before walking into lane
    - Show wards at 1753
    = Either keep courier until after the push, or drop them on the ground to collect. 

1802 Mechanics Missed lasthit (didn't prehit when there was time - ended with 2 creeps dying at almost the same time)

1817 Mechanics: Didn't shift queue movement after ward, slightly inefficient pathing

1818 Decision: Could have TP'd top,
    Arguments: back up the batrider, close distance to team
        = Could interrupt invokers TP out later, eclipse is on cooldown so fight is possible

1946 Decision: Hide in trees below T1 bottom
    - no way out, unlikely to fight
    = Position far back, use Fade Bold and run. 
        !could place ward, if they push further
    = Alternative don't TP at all, bad position to defend (need whole team)

2050 Itemisation: TP'd out of base with minimal cooldown on next observer ward
    -> could stay 6 seconds until it is ready

2330 Decision: Placed very optimistic ward
    - Likely to get dewarded when enemies reclaim their jungle
    - Didn't place sentry
    - very deep, as all lanes are pushed in
    - maybe try a safer ones

2331 Mechanics: Didn't shift queue movement after placing ward

2426 Execution: Didn't save Batrider
    - Walk towards Invoker to Telekinesis so he can't hit
2429 Execution: didn't steal spell,
    - Good opportunity after using Telekinesis+ Fade Bold, could get Impale! or Cold Snap
    screenshot
2533 Efficiency: Unnecessary use of Magic Stick
2600 Decision: Placed very defensive ward
    - Slightly different placement gives vision of left stairs as well
2605 Mechanics: Didn't drop magic stick before using Arcane Boots

2750 Efficiency: Killed creepcamp too late, blocking it
    -Missed 1-2 hits by walking back unnecessarily

3221 Execution: Walked too close when casting Fade Bolt, initiated and killed
    - Casted on an illusion that got disrupted and walked forward
    - A Forge Spirit would have been closer, didn't have to move in so far
    - Could TP earlier and cast before enemies get onto highground

3255 Information: Didn't check Enchantress as she walks into ward
    - Would see her place a ward, probably initiate in a different way?
    = Fight still works out 

3550 Mechanics: Missed lasthits on 3 melee creeps, 1 super ranged creep and catapult
    - Messed up the camera and kited around creeps
    - Could use stolen Nature's attendants and tank the creeps

3635 Mechanics: Missed lasthit (impatient, walked instead of hitting)
3638 Mechanics: Missed lasthit (impatient, hit ranged creep instead of hitting)
3640 Mechanics: Missed lasthit (early, underestimated HP of super range creep)

3650 Mechanics: Missed lasthit (hit ranged creep over taking lasthit)
3653 Mechanics: Missed lasthit (hit late)

3703 Mechanics: Didn't drop magic stick before using Arcane Boots
3745 Mechanics: Missed lasthit (checking allies inventories)
3747 Mechanics: Missed lasthit (careless)


3756 Mechanics: Didn't shift queue movement after placing ward
3756 Decision: Didn't place Sentry ward with observer
    = Nyx and Invoker

3838 Mechanics: Didn't shift queue movement after placing ward
3838 Decision: Didn't place Sentry ward with observer
    = Nyx and Invoker

4017 Information: Could infer from Enchantress' empty item slot that she recently placed a ward
    - Didn't check super-highround ward at Rosh (Storm walks close by with Gem)

4204 Execution:
    = Could have prevented Luna casting Eclipse with Telekinesis at 4204
        (Saves Ogre, but no stolen Eclipse vs Luna. Can steal Meteor, Deafening Blast or Disruption instead.
        Probably worth saving the Ogre, as Luna will die to Broodmother+Storm focus, additional stun from Ogre.
        Possibly Ignite to cancel Nyx's Blink dagger)
    - Late steal on Eclipse, could take it immediately after cast.

4305 Mechanics: Missed lasthit (wrong focus, prehits cause melee creep and catapult to die at the same time)
4309 Mechanics: Missed lasthit (wrogn focus, prehits case 2 melee creeps to die at same time)
4311 Mechanics: Missed lasthit (careless, prioritising hits on ranged creep)
4313 Mechanics: Missed lasthit (late attack)

4332 Itemisation: !important! Missed buying ward when in stock (Courier used by Ogre for Smoke, bring the ward along) 
4339 Decision: Place safe ward
    = Would be no problem with the additional ward
    - Ward is not immediately necessary, as controlling the area, have close vision with Batrider
    - Only ward available, want to gain more from that
    - !important! Opportunity for deeper wards at 4407  Fight at 4500 in this area!
     minimap with stronger wards

4445 Execution: 
    - stood too far back, didn't move in decisively
    - !important! 4451 wrong target: went towards Invoker in BKB, rightclicked
        4453 bad position, close to Luna (and Invoker)
        No need for telekinesis, Ogre can stun after BKB runs out, this is no initiation
        rather go for supports on the side with storm (saw SD)
        want to move to the side behind trees, cast 
    \screenshots

4655 Execution:
    - Could break Invoker's Linkens with spellsteal at 4756 (unused afterwards) so Storm can go
    - Stay for rightclicks+lift on Luna in BKB at 4706, rather run

4655 Execution:
    - Stay for rightclicks+lift on Luna in BKB at 4706, rather run

4732 Execution: Could steal Alacrity

4942 Execution:
    - Don't move towards the (disrupted) Luna at 4943
        Rather move downward across the fight to get to nyx
    - Needed to move up at 4947, no way out after moving right.
