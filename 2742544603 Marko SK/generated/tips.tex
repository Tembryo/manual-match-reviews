If your carry can farm without your help, or you can not zone the offlaner out of experience range, do pulls into neutral camps to increase the total experience collected. Never sit in lane to share experience with your carry if it is not necessary.

\item When playing against Bounty Hunter, always start with a set of Sentry Wards. This lets you zone him out of the lane from the very beginning.
\item Slark's Dark Pact purges debuffs and stuns for an extended duration. Rather use Burrow Strike a little later than risk your stun being purged off immediately.
\item You can reset tower aggro by issuing an attack command on an allied creep. Use this to reduce the damage taken from towers, e.g. at \logref{17:13}, \logref{30:18}
\item Sand King is a support that can farm comparatively quickly - use the jungle efficiently when there are no clear situations to make plays, stack and farm before you finish Blink Dagger and when your ultimate is on cooldown.
