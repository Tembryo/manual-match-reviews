Mid mirana
very tanky enemy team, no weak pickoffs
need to build advantage to be able to take solokills
provide lots of magic damage in fights, kill timbersaw
make space for morphling

possibility for good combination play: ganks with nyx, have huskar pressure and follow up

overall similar late game potential, a strong anti-mage could be dangerous

bought quickly, moved out

-0:07 +using arrow to scout -questionable direction. Aim toward one of the entrances, more likely the bottom one

1:33 missed lasthit (unnececssary hit trying to denie)
1:40 pushing lane a bit(4 hits, good to have more creeps as defense)

4:31 Good Play! Go farm jungle before next wave 
4:31 Good Play! Pinging out enemy Spirit Breakers charge movement
4:46 Good Play! Kill big creep with arrow and leave again 


5:07 Inefficient: Starstorm to push the wave. Could have hit two more targets, dont kill them before.
5:19 missed lasthit (too late)
5:44 missed lasthit on ranged creep (too late)
5:46 Going for top rune
5:46 Suboptimal movement (Have time to walk uphill and check befor going to rune).
6:00 Going for a gank on top - optimistic, as very little vision and only Arrow as disable.
6:11 Using Leap to speed up the gank and angle in from behind. 
6:16 Checking Timbersaws items before the gank. 
6:17 Run into Spirit Breaker.
6:23 Good Play! Killing the Spirit Breaker with Starstorm and rightclicks, keeping Arrow. 
6:26 Mistake! Staying in the fight, commiting to kill Pudge. Should just run, can't save and very hard kills. Can try to stay, but need to keep Mana for Leap. Death to Timbersaw after going in and using Arrow + Starstorm.
6:51 Checking Scoreboard 
7:01 Checking Timbersaws items
7:02 Checking Morphlings items
7:04 Looking at situation in bottom lane.
7:12 Respawn, TP top to gank Timbersaw. Unlikely, but high reward - need to hit a decent Arrow to kill.
        Other options: 
        TP mid to farm (low reward, dangerous, no vision and could be alone vs. Spirit Breaker/ Pudge).
        Walk into own jungle, farm, move out (No risk, gold reward and off the map).
7:16 Showing to creeps top, gank fails.
7:30 Farm Hardcamp
7:40 Good play! Run into Pudge, quick leap out. 
7:43 Risky Play! Running towards mid into Spirit Breaker, instead move up. [Minimap]
8:00 Go to take bottom rune.
8:06 Move bottom for a gank on Anti-Mage.
8:15 Good Play! Holding Arrow for a more likely shot (cant hit vs. Blink), instead moving in.
8:19 Good Play! Still holding Arrow, moving in.
8:21 Mistake! Need to realise that position inside T1 Tower is really dangerous. TPs possible, bad escape options.

8:19 Guessing Anti-Mages position, giving allies vision on Anti-Mage with Arrow.
8:28 Using leap to give Huskar vision on Anti-Mage.
8:32 Killing the Anti-Mage
8:54 Death due to overextension. Chase the Anti-Mage too far, no escape possible.
9:10 Bad trade overall. Gave up 3 kills for Anti-Mage, who was in a weak position anyway. 

9:26 Good Play! TP Bottom to save Huskar
9:36 Good Play, hitting Axe with Arrow, Starstorm on 3. 2 Kills.

9:46 Inefficient! Unnecessary hits on creep, using Starstorm anyway. 
9:53 Missed Lasthit (hit wrong creep)
9:54 Starstorm to kill the creepwave.

10:08 Rune is taken, go farm hard camp.

11:37 Good time to move back, lane is pushed, enemies missing.

12:06 Good TP top, push out enemy team.
12:06 Late TP from base, could go 3 seconds earlier (have Bottle+Fountain buff)
12:20 Good arrow, killing Spirit Breaker.

13:56 Good Play! Good fight, trading Huskar for 2 Axe and Sprit Breaker.

14:00 Good Play! Taking fight against Anti-Mage, forcing him to Blink out.
14:07 Mistake! Guessing wrong Blink direction, missing Leap. Losing a kill on Anti-Mage. 
14:22 Missed Lasthit (too late)
14:47 Inefficient Movement. What happened: Walking below hardcamp, using arrow to kill big creep. Running to base mit mana for one Starstorm.
Instead: Kill small creeps with Starstorm, use arrow to kill big creep, walk base from there. + Gold, full camp for next time (opportunity at 19:25, farmed at 22:20).

17:31 Mistake! Farming hardcamp, delaying the push.
17:51 Mistake! Standing close to creepwave and Morphling, in range for Berserkers Call.
17:53 Mistake! Used Leap, then ran back in. Can't stand close enough for Starstorm without Leap. Bad Fight, should not follow Huskar's jump(5v5, enemy has advantage, Omni Ultimate used, Damage from Call).  

18:46 Checking Scoreboard, Pudges, Timbersaws, Anti-Mages items.

19:07 TP mid, farming and pushing out Axe.

21:41 Timbersaw dies (to initiaion)
21:45 Use Dums unnecessarily

22:07 Using Starstorm to clear creepwave

22:08 Decide to back off and not push for T1 (good as Pudge+Anti-Mage missing, death to Pudge blink initiation)

22:20 Farm Hardcamp (missing big creep from earlier)

22:29 Landing Arrow, Starstorm combo

22:37 Good Play! Dodge the hook, reinitiate, get the Aghs nuke.
22:34 Staying close, accept Pudge using Dismember.
22:47 Using Arrow to kill Pudge, wasting Starstorm.
        -> Better Options: Use Starstorm only, less cooldown. Want to use Arrow at 22:55
        Option 2: Save both, with risk of Pudge self-denying with Rot. 

22:53 Good Play! Choose to chase Spirit Breaker.
23:02 Good Play! Leap to close distance, landing Starfall combo.
23:04 Killing Spirit Breaker.

23:05 Moving toward mid to farm

23:14 Boots of Travel TP to bot to farm/push.
23:15 Could use time to view Timbersaw top.
23:20 Use Starstorm combo to clear creepwave.

23:21 Inefficient: Immediately walk to base, could farm harcamp with remaining Mana.

23:57 Farm Hardcamp (could take the one spawning at 24:00 if farmed before)

24:04 Good Play! BoT top to farm/push.
24:07 Checking Timbersaw 
24:07 Clearing creewave without using late Starstorm, good.

24:40 Starstorm dodged by Pudge blinking out (unintentional).
24:50 Viewing incoming Spirit Breaker.
24:53 Aghs Nuke wasted by standing too close to Neutrals. Want it in the fight vs Spirit Breaker.
24:54 Hitting Arrow on Spirit Breaker

25:15 Risky Play! Inviting enemy team into chase instead of escaping immediately.
        Should have died (Possible Hook at 25:31, Anti-Mage and Pudge)
25:20 Using Starstorm to farm neutral camp and harass Anti-Mage.
25:22 Walk into Anti-Mage, accepting hits, canceling Blink Dagger.
25:22 Juke Anti-Mage, changing direction.
25:22 Juke Anti-Mage, changing direction.
25:31 Dodge Dismember by using Leap quickly. Possible Hook 

25:38 Go to heal up at fountain.

    Better Option: Blink at 25:15, farm medium camp (Starstorm combo, Arrow on big Centaur). Move toward mid, nuke creepwave, take bottom rune, (maybe wait for Rune spawning at 26:00)
    Result: + 8 creeps, bounty rune, can continue farming enemy jungle. Leaves farm top for Morphling.


25:50 BoT to top to Farm/Push
25:54 Kill creepwave with starstorm combo.
26:06 Kill creepwave with Aghs Nuke.(Should have used Starstorm, not used within cooldown).

26:44 Shoot bad arrow. (Secure hit at 26:48)
26:49 Unnecessary short blink forward.
26:55 Mistake! Leap into enemy team for kill on Axe. No way to escape (Leap on cooldown, Blink Dagger disabled, dusted, no fast enough)

Result: 2v4 trade, own death.
    Good execution: Pickoff on Axe. Maybe able to kill Rosh.
Options: Farm Jungle towards mid, delay the fight a bit. (slightly better)
    Farm Hardcamp, push top, use BoT to come mid after forcing TP.

28:02 Checked Scoreboard
28:10 Viewed top
28:12 TP mid

    TP top, free farm, push on T1

28:17 Missed Lasthit (hit the wrong creep)

28:26 Farm Hardcamp
28:37 Farm Mid (ok, can take farm from Huskar. better than from nxy)
28:49 Inefficient Decide to farm mid instead of clearing medium camp 

29:02 Initiate agression by using Ultimate (optimistic, no vision, can't kill Anti-Mage)
        Works, as enemies walk in
29:06 keeping vision, waiting for opportunity

29:10 Fight against Timbersaw, Spirit Breaker
29:12 Hit Arrow on Spirit Breaker

29:20 Chase with Leap, Kill Spirit Breaker
29:20 Chase for Timbersaw
29:22 Blink forward for Timbersaw, got juked, Anti-Mage there.

29:42 Leap out (Hook is used)
29:44 Go Back (good)

29:55 Kill small camp (good)
30:02 Kill hard camp (good)

30:02 Mistake: Don't check rune
30:10 Inefficient: Walk to base
        Better: Take Regen rune on Bottom. Slight risk of dying to Axe+Timbersaw, but Pudge is showing mid.

30:15 Dont react to information:
    Timbersaw shows top, can risk taking the Regen rune.
30:19 Mistake: Decide to not take Hard camp but run to base.
    Can farm Hard camp, area is safe, have Mana left.

30:34 Swap in Bottle for faster regen.

30:42 BoT to T2 top 
    Inefficient, can port to creep.

30:48 kill creepwave with combo

31:00 Move to mid to fight (good, leaves farm top for Morphling)

33:25 Farm/push mid
        Good, pressuring and bating with team behind.

33:29 BoT top
33:32 Cancelled by Axe, Axe dies
33:46 Start farming Ancient cmap
33:50 Use Blink to move

33:51 Leap forward
33:52 Move in behin T2 to force out Anti-Mage
33:57 Hit Timbersaw with Arrow
34:03 Death

35:44 Inefficient. Missed Aghs Nuke damage for wrong approach to neutral camp.

35:54 Bad Arrow 
36:00 Clear creepwave with starstorm

Inefficient Movement: Stay around lane with opponent without impact. 
    Instead: Farm jungle

36:04 Inefficient: 
    Gives information, takes time, no damage.
    Return to Lane and hit Timbersaw

36:12 Hit Tower
36:21 Walk back

36:30 Farm Neutrals

36:38 Fight Spirit Breaker (good position, no risk) 
36:40 Chase for Pudge

36:53 Chase for Pudge
36:58 Miss Arrow, miss second Starstorm damage.
        Want to cast arrow later, was not necessary. 


37:05 Inefficient: Use Ultimate to chase more. Timbersaw/ Anti-Mage are to fast, not enough disable to kill.
    Better: BoT bottom to push

37:16 Dangerous. Blink over River to chase. Could get killed by Timbersaw + Anti-Mage. 

37:18 Arrow to scout 

37:20 Inefficient: Chase the Timbersaw. No way to kill, slightly dangerous (could die do Anti-Mage blinking in).
        Instead: BoT top to push the T1.
        Or: BoT bottom,to farm (lets Morphling farm top)

37:47 BoT top, clear creepwave with Starstorm

37:49 Inefficient: Port to melee creep saves Blink use.
        Speeds up farming to stack hardcamp.

38:30 Try an arrow on Spirit Breaker, then farm creepwave

39:14 Initiate Agression with Ultimate
39:19 Good Play! Hit Pudge with Arrow.

39:33 Good leap to chase

39:40 Good Play! Decide to chase Axe
39:42 Inefficient: Dont use Blink Dagger to close the distance.
        Mechanics: Opportunity to dodge reflected Ethereal Blade with Blink Dagger and blink forward.

39:50 Inefficient: Hitting Blademail keeps Blink Dagger on cooldown. Wait for Blink+Starstorm
39:53 Land Leap to kill with Starfall

40:15 Inefficient: TP top on tower
    BoT on creep to clear the wave with Aghs Nuke. (slightly risky, as Anti-Mage could kill creep with fast reaction)

40:21 Missed lasthit (hit wrong creep)
40:22 Missed lasthit (too late)

40:40 Clear creepwave (with starstorm)
40:51 Clear creepwave (with starstorm)

41:01 Kill tower

41:19 Arrow to scout, sees charge

41:25 Go back since charged
41:27 Good Leap over barrier
41:30 Inefficient: Didnt take Bounty rune on the way
41:38 Inefficient: Walked by neutral camp and didnt kill it.

41:44 Go for a pickoff on Spirit Breaker.
41:45 Arrow to scout, with decent chance to hit. Path taken was likely, should have aimed right.

41:48 Mistake! Used Starfall out of range for second hit.
            Better: immediately commit leap for quick kill.
            Option2: keep until in range.

41:53 Bad leap, missing the kill.
41:59 Mistake! Keep chasing on low HP without escape. Could run up to escape. leads to death
42:02 Mistake! Don't use Blink Dagger quick enough, letting it get cancelled. 
42:05 Mistake! Using Arrow instead of Starfall, loses kill on Spirit Breaker.

43:46 BoT Bottom into fight
43:46 Good Play! Chase for Axe, return gem.
43:49 Suboptimal play. Using Arrow before Leap secures kill.

43:54 Bad Arrow

43:19 Farm small camp
43:28 Farm hard camp

43:32 Go for Rosh, hit Arrow
