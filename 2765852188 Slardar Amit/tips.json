        "Be quick at buying items before deaths in the early game, the gold you save has a big impact.",
        "Using Blink Dagger and Sprint optimally to move faster can make your game more efficient and give you that decisive little edge over the enemies.",
        "Use pings or your microphone to communicate initiations with your team so that they follow up.",
        "While Eul's Scepter removes debuffs from you, it also rets you up for enemy initiation. Often just walking out of the situation is safer.",
        "When retreating during a teamfight, try to stay away from your squishy allies like Sniper. Rather escape a bit sideways, so that your allies can safely attack whoever is chasing after you.",
        "As initiator, buying a BKB against Silencer's Global Silence is very important - Eul's Scepter will stop your initiation just as much as the silence.",
        "Make sure that you are backed up by enough allies to kill when initiating a pickoff in the lategame. If you fight for a long time, support will come and lead to a teamfight."
