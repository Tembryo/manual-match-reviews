Phantom Assassin's Blink Strike works on Roshan. Use it as often as possible to boost your attack speed and kill Roshan much faster.

\item Black King Bar is only worth buying early if it protects you from big spells in midgame fights. In this game all the important spells (Fiends Grip, Doom, Rupture) pierce BKB. A Linkens Sphere would protect you far more effectively.
\item As midlaner prioritise getting Boots and a TP scroll really early - usually as second item after Bottle. This speeds up the movement for runes and gives you the option to counter-TP when the enemy midlaner goes for a gank.
\item Small inefficiencies add up - be disciplined about always using PA's abilities to farm faster and always use Phaseboots to move.
\item Use Blink Strike on allied units when chasing to close the distance for a Dagger or get the next Blink Strike forward.
\item Be more careful about farming neutrals deep in enemy territory. Got caught 3 times, giving up 2 very expensive deaths and causing a bad teamfight.
\item Use BKB before entering a big teamfight (before the Blink in).
