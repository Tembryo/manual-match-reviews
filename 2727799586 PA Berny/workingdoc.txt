starting items:
stout shield, blight stone
-057 inefficiency: bought slow, start moving now
-030 information: stopped moving with ward in inventory
    -> place it now, before laning

018 information walk into lane with ward

031 missed lasthit (too early (5hp) )
032 missed lasthit (didnt use dagger to lasthit)
041 missed lasthit (too early, dagger to contest vs pudge)

149 missed lasthit (didnt use dagger)
237 missed lasthit (walked back for courier)
242 missed lasthit (too early)

324 try gank with haste rune
    = potential to kill LC

436 missed lasthit (too early)

good play: letting pudge hook for a go

445 missed kill on pudge:
    let him self-deny
    instead: don't do last hit, wait for dagger to get ready

454 missed lasthit (too early / could have used dagger)
502 missed lasthit (too early)

522 good gank bottom with rune

544 missed lasthit (impatient)

628 bad go on on sandking (use of invis rune):
    no chance to kill (very unlikely to have no sandstorm)
    good chance to find + kill LC


646 missed kill on pudge:
    let him self-deny
    instead: don't do last hit, walk close, wait for dagger to get ready

647 missed opportunity to buy TP -> sideshop, will likely move mid


726 good go on LD

814 good go on LC

921 bad blink into fight
    pudge+sk under tower, just run

1147 missed lasthit (hit wrong creep)

1153 missed opportunity to buy tp at sideshop

1230 death
    +LC blink was suprising
    -WD didn't use heal

1438 inefficient
    didnt use spells to farm camp
        !full mana
        !low(er) hp

1512 inefficient
    didnt use dagger to farm camp
        !more mana
        !low(er) hp

1556 missed lasthit (didnt watch wave for dagger)

1604 death to tiny
    - walking around with low HP
    + new blink
    - had to expect blink to soon come up
    - had no vision, knew enemies were nearby

!!! decision making:
    did ping enemy position!
    need to realize that initiating teamfights is impossible
    lots of magic burst damage, all heroes squishy
    can only fight if enemies use spells separately - super hard
->
{{
1649 bad tp mid
    - towards enemy team

1655 walk uphill

1708 death in fight
    - too low maxhp/too much magic damage
    - cant go into fight
    - lucky that tiny didnt burst immediately
}}
{{ 
   !!instead TP bottom 1649, split/move to ancient jungle

}}

1833 Fight in jungle
    well executed 4:3 trade

2009 bad go into tiny - should have immediately died to combo


!!! decision makign:
    keep fighting into sk/tiny  with reduced HP

2053 go onto tiny
    leads to death



2200 good TP top

!!decision making
    walk over to mid as they fight pudge
    should farm jungle, no need to help there
    want to spread and maximize farm
    dont want to show, dangerous with 3 blinks and lots of burst

bad movement
top t2-> mid t2 - mid t1 - farm mid wave  -stay and farm next wave
instead - farm jungle
top t2 -> medium camp -> hard camp -> medium camp rune

2221 should die do sk+tiny 

good decision making!!
    find DD
    see SK mid
2315 take rosh 

!!need to check more items, no idea how strong they are

2445 inefficient movement
    bad pathing above ancient camp to creepwave
    misses 2 creeps
    saw them mid, cant 
2457 missed lasthit (hit wrong creep)

2452 inefficient farming: didnt use blink strike to creepwave

2502 missed lasthit (impatient, )

2503 !decision making:
    tiny sk pudge show mid
    -> wave bottom is safe to farm

2504 inefficient movment:
    !missing information: need to view drows movement
    walk to hardcamp
    team is farming that
    instead: immediately farm ancients
        !avoids dangerous situation

2744 inefficient: use blink strike to clear creepwave

2746
    !decision making
        should farm enemy jungle toward bottom
            enemies are respawning/ in base
            lots of space available
            spread out 
{{
    2813 missed opportunity to buy TP, usign courier
    walk to secret shop
    farm ancients
    walk mid

    2830 !decision making
        should not try to fight there
        no vision
        nothing to gain, own lane is pushed in
        Lina is out of mana, global silence on cooldown
}}
{{ 
   !!instead farm radiant jungle toward bottom, kill one wave

}}

2947 missed opportunity to buy TP
    replace Raindrops! 

3004 !decision making should push out top

    inefficient movement farming mid
        allies in mid, sharing farm with drow
        only 2 camps next to secret shop to continue
    farm top instead 
        big creepwave
        should push top
        can continue jungle

3056 !decision making should push out bottom
    !missing tp, could have bought at 2947

3236 inefficient movement: walk mid then bot
    bottom needs to be pushed, go there immediately

3320 missed lasthit (wrong creep)

3415
    good call: take rosh

4032 missed opportunity to buy TP

4130 !decision making
    enemies could push top rax, no tp!

4221 decision making: 
    fighting with only 3 for enemy base
    no TP out
        -> should run 
4225 fight execution:
    run up instead of towards team

4519 !decision making:
    killed 4, go for objectives

    did: farmed ancients, moved to bottom

    should: push mid

    use phaseboots always!
