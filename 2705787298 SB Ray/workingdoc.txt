Match Context:
Solo AP ranked
Offlane, Roaming/initiator - Goal is to gain an advantage through kills and become strong enough to initiate fights with charge. 

Highlight tip:
Empowering Haste has an active part, use it to boost movespeed (and thereby damage) in fights!

Summary:
+ Effective itembuild. Get Stout Shield, buy Quelling Blade at the sideshop.
+ Good laning, punishing solo Sven
+ Successful aggressive ganks.
- Unused skills/abilities: Empowering Haste, sometimes Urn and Drums. 
- Unnecessary deaths to overconfidence, might have been able to escape with charge.

Tips:

- Only hero and tower damage cancels Urn regeneration, use it to stay healthy when tanking creepwaves.
- When you have charges available, use Urn agressively when you enter the fight.
- Prioritise killing the ranged creep when pushing a lane.
- When pushing lanes later in the game, make sure to lasthit the enemy creeps receiving damage from your creeps. 
- Be patient and take safe lasthits over pushing a little bit more.


Itemisation:
= starting items
    + good windlace
    - need more regen in lane
    - should get stout shield (melee - will take creep hits)
    - quelling blade unnecessary, buy at sideshop if needed (1v1 against sven)
+ early urn, Power Treads
+ Echo Saber to push advantage
= Progression Drums, Sange and Yasha: could aim for bigger items.

1905 missed opportunity to buy TP


Laning

034 missed lasthit (denied, stood too far)
057 missed lasthit (too late)
135 missed lasthit (too late)
308 missed lasthit (stood on wrong side of creepwave)
310 missed lasthit (too late)

153 good kill on sven!
    creep advantage by killing range+1 melee
    hits to harass, bashes!
    finish off

158 missed opportunity to pull lane back: 
    only lasthit, denie own creeps


258 missed kill on Sven: use charge early to set up arrow, don't rely on bashes

320 missed opportunity to sidepull hardcamp

Mechanics:

- Accidentally pooled tango to Omniknight at -032
- 537 salve cancelled by riki (just killed spectre)

= inefficient farming:
    left creep in camp 1401, slows down next ally farming the camp
    instead: at least kill the creep, even better stack at 13:55

= miscalculated cost for item: 
    selling quelling blade to empty the slot gives enough gold to finish item.
    no need to farm another camp.

= charge out from fountain instead of walking 
    1020 walk mid - charge either sven top or CM in mid. can probably fight mid

= kill ranged creep first when pushing 1200 1729 1857 2246

- Didn't use available urn charges to heal 2015, 2205 (leads to death later). Urn is not cancelled by creeps!

- Missed free lasthits.
    Frequently ignored lasthit lost to own creeps 2212 2213 2513 2536 or hit too early 1720 1737 2220 2222 2451 2453 2510

Fight Execution

+ good charge 1120 1620
+ good delay of fight 1230
    let enemies dive tower, then initiate

= unnecessary dust in sentry 1310


- Never used active component of Empowering Haste. Activate when entering fight, examples at 352 504 834 848 1120 1243 1452 1648 2157 2706

- Missed aggressive uses of Urne:  1243 (save use of Ultimate) 1452 1459 1648 1919 2157

- Didn't use Drums of Endurance 2243 (Escape), 2515 (push!) 2706(fight!)
 
- unnecessary death! Didn't use available skills to escape: Drums, Empowering Haste, Urn charge to disable blink, charge away in fog 2246
    

Movement

+ good TP to speed up kill on Nature's Prophet 2148

=  undecisive movement 554, TP top  621
    -> rather charge top

= suboptimal movement: farm hardcamp, farm medium camp, then walk to fountain
    or: farm medium camp, then hardcamp, then go to base.

- 906 bad TP top: rather TP base and charge out
    out of mana, low HP
    money to buy items
    -have to walk to base afterwards
[Minimap]


Strategic Decisions:

+ Good decision to heal after early fight

+ Good aggressive play, pushing advantage

- 936 walk into lane with low HP
    should die to Sven here
    no mana for charge out

- Farming right outside enemy base 2050
    Small chance to escape by charging bottom
