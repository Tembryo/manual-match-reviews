Anti-Mage by iceiceiceiceiceiceiceiceice, played on 29/09/2016

Match Context:
Unranked AP as 2-Stack. 
Imbalanced team performance, need to make up for the weaker mates with strong play to win the game. Enemies are occupied with the rest of the team, focus is on efficient farming and pressure through split push. 

Analysis Summary:

+ Good early itemisation, effective item progression
+ Good movement, farming and splitpush
- Missed early opportunities for pressure
- Efficiency improvements: early lasthitting, tread switching, movement patterns
- Unnecessary deaths due to wrong escape directions



Laning:

- After 10 Creepwaves (5:22):
        22 LH/ 4 denied
        missed 15 LH, 8 denies
0 After 20 Creepwaves (5:22):
        56/19
        missed 22 LH, 13 denies
- Repeated causes for misses:
    - Standing too far back (14x).
    - Impatience, hit too early (5x)
    - Drew creeps closer by taking Aggro, but didn't move in afterwards. (2x)


Itemisation:

+ Starting items:
    Tangoes, Salve, 2 Branches to consume with Tango, Stout Shield

+ Early Poor Man's Shield, Ring of Health

+ Power Treads, Battle Fury

+ Good item progression into Vladimir's Offering, Manta Style, Abyssal Blade.

- Missed 2 opportunities to buy TP at sideshops when it was needed. (24:08, crucial at 41:10)

Mechanics:

- Toggle treads to Intelligence before using Blink (18 times), especially early or when on low mana.
0 Slow TP from base - use the regeneration buff, loses a lasthit and 5 seconds.
0 Treadswitch to Str when backing from tower.
0 Dont blink out of neutral camps before killing the last one -  loses 6 seconds.
0 Blink forward in the lane and move to cleave the ranged creep.
0 Blink as quickly as possible when you are moving.


Information & Assessment:

- Didn't check inventory of lane opponent when arriving

- Didn't view the ganks of lane opponent - missing skill information.

- Didn't check inventory of enemy entering the lane - didn't realise own advantage (3x) (6:01)

- Didn't notice damage output on creeps to infer skillpoint assignment and hero strength. (10:40)


Fighting:

+ Good blinks for solo kills on Omniknight and PL (19:00, 19:42)
+ Good solokill on Pudge (49:15)

0 Dangerous aggressive movement, but goes unpunished and creates pressure. (27:20, 28:40, 30:10, 30:50)  
0 Using ultimate for harassment damage without kill potential.

- Using Ultimate into Blademail(31:00).
- Unnecessary deaths due to wrong escape path. Rather move towards your allies (24:50), stay hidden in trees (37:28) and don't corner yourself(52:50).
[minimap 1][minimap2][minimap3]

- Unnecessary deaths for staying in lost fight (33:20, 47:40).


Movement:

+ Switched lane in reaction to stubborn teammate. (0:50)

0 Left fountain early, but then stayed in bad position behind tower
    Better: Move into jungle to have more vision

    [minimap image]



- Missed opportunities to push the lane and create pressure (6:18 opponent dead, 8:40 opponent shows somewhere else)

+ Went to fountain to heal at a good time

- Suboptimal movement at 16:00, missing out on 8 creeps.
       Order was: stack hardcamp, farm medium camp, farm hardcamp, move to mid
       Instead: stack hardcamp, kill 2 creep waves mid, kill medium camp, kill stacked hardcamp
[minimap 1][minimap 2]

- Suboptimal Movement at 19:50
    What happened: went to rune, went back to lane (too late, missing 2 creeps), waited a creepwave, delayed then pushed it (dangerous, go immediately if you want to take the risk), went to jungle.
    Better:
        At 19:54 see axe/mirana mid, turn and kill creepwave bottom, then take rune
        Option 1: farm hardcamp, go farm jungle
            - one creepwave, + hard and medium camp near mid
            safer, as creepwave bot was dangerous

        Option 2:
        Then return to lane, push wave(dangerous), move into jungle
        equal risk, + 1 hard camp, map pressure/tower damage bottom, faster

        [minimap 1][minimap 2][minimap3]

- Suboptimal Movement at 28:52
    What jappened: Take top rune, hard camp, ancient camp, top lane
    better: Stack ancient camp, top rune, farm ancient camp, hard camp, top lane.
[minimap 1][minimap 2]

+ Good splitpush delaying the push.(37:10, 39:10, 44:50, 50:30)



Log:

-1:08 Bought quickly, moved out
-0:35 Stopped moving - Move in to have vision of area in jungle, prevent wards

0:50 Good choice: Adjust laning to accommodate Team (TP mid)
0:50 Didn't check items of lane opponent.

1:06 Missed LH (standing too far)
1:17 Missed LH (didn't prehit in tower)
1:20 Missed LH (standing too far) 
1:25 Missed Denie (standing too far) 
1:35 Missed Denie (standing too far) 
1:38 Missed Denie (standing too far) 
1:58 Missed LH (waited too long)
2:10 Missed LH (prehit in tower, more time by not hitting ranged creep)
2:30 Missed LH (drew agro and backed - should draw agro and go in)
3:10 Missed Denie on Ranged Creep (ran too far back)
3:22 Missed LH (impatient, hit too early)
3:32 Missed LH  (standing too far, drew agro then didnt move in)
3:47 Missed LH on Ranged Creep (standing too far, moved around to drop creep agro, need to blink in)
3:48 Missed LH (cancelled the attack)
3:55 Missed LH (impatient, didnt wait for your creeps to hit)
4:09 Missed LH (standing too far, moved out unnecessarily)
4:28 Missed Denie (too defensive)

5:40 Mirana ganks bottom Lane, didnt view. Gives information that she put skillpoints into Arrow and not Starfall.

4:56 Missed Denie (hit wrong creep)
4:57 Missed Denie (hit wrong creep)
4:59 Missed Denie (moved out too early)
5:06 Missed LH (moved out too far)
5:09 Missed LD (moved out unnecessarily)
5:22 Missed LH (hit too early)
5:32 Missed LH (moved somewhere else, hard to click as right next to tower)
5:34 Missed LH (walked away)

6:00 Missed Denie (moved instead of attacking)

6:01 Mirana returns to lane, didn't check items.

6:06 Missed Denie (dangerous, but can blink)
6:15 Missed LH  (walked too far back, can tank 2 creeps)

6:18 Mirana dies to mines, kept lane static. Should immediately push the lane
    or kill rangecreep, then push with the next wave with catapult.
    Missed lots of possible tower damage.

7:05 Should move in to hit ranged creep and catapult to increase the push.

7:22 Mirana returns to lane - Didn't check items to notice power difference (15dmg, 150hp).

7:23 Missed Denie
7:29 Missed Denie
7:37 Missed Denie(hard to get, have to agressively go in and fight - but have advantage)
7:50 Step into Arrow 
7:43 Missed LH (stunned by arrow)
7:47 Missed LH (stunned by arrow)

8:40 Mirana shows bot, did not react. Look there and start pushing mid.
       What happened: denied your 2nd range creep, kept denying, own creeps died quickly.
       Instead: blink forward on wave at 8:50, kill ranged, keep pushing.
           Can hit the tower with 2 ranged and 2 melee creeps.

8:54 Missed LH (impatient, hit too early)

9:20 Not pushing the lane without threat. Dangerous enemies (Mirana, Pudge) are visible, can kill ranged creep early and hit T1 tower with ranged+2 melee creeps.

10:02 Missed LH (impatient, hit too early)
    
10:10 Mirana returns to lane, didn't check items. She still has only boots, would notice the power difference.
  
10:40 Didn't notice power advantage to play aggressively.
        Mirana hits you for no dmg, casts Starstorm with low damage. Can play very agressively and push her away from the creepwave.

11:40 Mirana returns to lane - Didn't check items to notice big power difference (1 level, over 2k more gold in items).

12:38 Good blink onto Mirana to deal harassment damage.
12:41 Unnecessary ultimate, no way to kill. Rather keep hitting.


12:46 Toggle Power Treads to Strength against tower hits.

13:05 Good decision to go to fountain and heal, no good other options.


13:36 Slow on the TP back to front. Lost 5 seconds, missed 1 LH.

14:20 T1 mid dies. For comparison, with the damage possible at 6:18, 8:40, it dies at least one creepwave earlier, letting you farm 1-2 neutral camps or take damage on T2.


14:55  Passive movement. Decision to farm jungle ater killing the medium camp, yields 390 gold, purchase battlefury at sideshop, have to move back through empty jungle but manage to stack.
       Instead: Blink back towards mid, kill 2 waves of creeps (no danger, as mirana is moving top, pudge is top), kill medium and large camp, send courier with battlefury, kill next wave mid
           ->free tower damage on T2 mid, Huskar/Juggernaut can farm jungle around bottom lane.

14:58 Blinked with Power Treads on Intelligence. 7 Blinks from 14:58 - 16:00

16:10 Farmed stack with Power Treads on Intelligence. Switching to Agility improves damage output and reduces damage taken. 

16:00 Inefficent farm movement pattern, missing out on 8 creeps.
       Order was: stack hardcamp, farm medium camp, farm hardcamp, move to mid
       Instead: stack hardcamp, kill 2 waves mid, kill medium camp, kill stacked hardcamp


17:00 Blocked hardcamp, could have blinked out (prefer blinking early for efficiency anyway). Missed chance to have farmed these creeps at 17:40.


18:00 Blocked ancient camp at due to indecision. Direct movement at 17:38 speeds up clearing the camp.
  
18:30 Blink out before killing last neutral, losing  about 6 seconds. 
  
19:00 Good blink to kill PL.

19:03 Blink on Agility Treads, again at 19:11

19:20 Inefficient hit order on neutral creep: Can save 1 hit by cleaving the large ghost (only need 2 direct hits, can use 3rd on small one).

19:42 Good blink to kill Omniknight Could have been a bit closer, but was good enough.

19:50 Suboptimal Movement What happened: went to rune, went back to lane (too late, missing 2 creeps), waited a creepwave, delayed then pushed it (dangerous, go immediately if you want to take the risk), went to jungle.
Better:
At 19:54 see axe/mirana mid, turn and kill creepwave bottom, then take rune
    Option 1: farm hardcamp, go farm jungle
    - one creepwave, + hard and medium camp near mid
    safer, as creepwave bot was dangerous

    Option 2:
    Then return to lane, push wave(dangerous), move into jungle
    equal risk, + 1 hard camp, map pressure/tower damage bottom, faster
   

22:50 Blink on Agility Treads, 9 Blinks in 22:50-24:10 (22:50, 23:00, 23:10, 23:24, 23:31, 22:38, 22:53, 24>00, 24:10). Especially critical as on low mana. 
   
22:54 Time inefficiency
    Didnt blink forward to creepwave at 
    Didnt move forward to cleave range creep at 22:58, saves 1 or 2 hits
   
23:10 Cut tree in Radiant easy camp to move towards next camp, maybe use blink earlier camp.


24:08 Missed opportunity to buy TP at sideshop (TP bot after taking the tower is very likely)


24:50 Mistake! blink down/towards river instead of left/toward teammate
    Dangerous territory, no vision, saw moonlight shadow on PL
    enemies are there, leads to death


27:20 Risky Play
    Showing bottom, very likely to die to axe+pudge+mirana+omni
        Initiation by Axe call and Moonlight shadow possible!


27:30 Good choice to splitpush. Fight is lost/not much to do, instead taking T2 bottom.


28:40 Risky Play
    Hitting T2 mid is very dangerous
        Initiation by Axe call + pudge+ omni
        Next to 3 creepwaves, counter helix might be enough for a kill


30:10 Risky move into enemy jungle: all 5 missing, if they see you moving with a ward, you die.
    Hight reward, as draws 3 people towards mid and away from top.

28:52 Inefficient movement:
    What jappened: Take top rune, hard camp, ancient camp, top lane
    better: Stack ancient camp, top rune, farm ancient camp, hard camp, top lane.


30:50 Agressive move in risky situation. Fighting into Axe, no vision on area where enemy team is coming from, own team is far.
31:00 Mistake! Use Ultimate into Blademail, almost die to it.


31:25 Didn't blink out of fountain for 5 seconds, essentially one more blink.
31:50 Didn't blink for 10 seconds, 1 or 2 more blinks.


31:35 Suboptimal Movement
    What happened: tried to chase axe/pudge, no way to reach, then farmed neutrals
    could do: push mid instead, take T2
    could do: take Roshan


33:14 Walk into arrow
    Endangers Rhasta, but would should be fine if he hexed
   
33:20 Mistake:
    Indecision if the fight is good, staying too long and dying to 5
        One Ally is dead, Mirana ultimate active and no detection available. Leads to death.


37:10 Good play: splitpush draws enemy team back, saves T2 mid/ prevents fight


37:28 Mistake! Blinking out of the trees, enemy team is likely still around
        could easily blink further down through the trees
        results in death


39:10 Effective splitpush, draws back enemy team


41:10 Mistake! Miss opportunity to buy TP at sideshop, (likely want to tp out after splitting/to start split on the other side), want to use TP later at 42:14.
        TP later at 42:42, the delay lets enemies take rax uncontested at 43:40.
Options:
    TP bottom and fight (saw pudge top, would have been a 5v3 fight wit late PL, decent chance of winning)
    TP mid, for faster push (better than pushing top)


44:50 Good splitpush, drawing enemy team top to chase


47:30 Killing omni
- pop manta after abyssal, speed up the kill
- ultimate blocked by repel, waited too long
    result still good


47:40 Mistake! Stayed to fight PL, should blink out
    Results in death, rebuy.



47:58 rebuy had no specific reason, but will probably have to be used, so OK.


48:30 Mechanics: trying to drop Treads for gem and being too slow
    Is only a slightly good trade, so OK. Could have sold Treads earlies for i.e. dust.


49:15 Good play killing pudge


49:40 Good splitpush taking T2 mid


50:30 good decision to push top


51:10 good decision to enter base, forcing pudges BKB


52:10 Canceled TP to split top, would have been good


52:40 Good play killing pudge


52:50 Mistake! Try to hide in trees vs PL - could have blinked down over trees and kept running
    Results in death.
