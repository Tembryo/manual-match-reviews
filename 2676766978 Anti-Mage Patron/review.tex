\paragraph{Match Context}
Unranked AP as 2-Stack.

Imbalanced team performance, had to make up for three weaker allies with strong play to win the game. Enemies are occupied with the rest of the team, focus is on efficient farming and pressure through split push. 

\section*{Summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Summary}

\begin{remarks}
\goodremark{Good early itemisation, effective item progression.}
\goodremark{Good movement, farming and splitpush.}
\badremark{Missed early opportunities for pressure.}
\badremark{Efficiency improvements: early lasthitting, tread switching, movement patterns.}
\badremark{Unnecessary deaths due to wrong escape directions or staying in lost fights.}
\end{remarks}

\section{Laning}

\begin{remarks}
\badremark{ After 10 creepwaves (5:22):\\
        22 lasthits/ 4 denies\\
        Missed 15 lasthits, 8 denies}
\neutralremark{ After 20 Creepwaves (10:02):\\
        56 lasthits, 19 denies\\
        Missed 22 lasthits, 13 denies.}
\end{remarks}

\paragraph{Frequent reasons for missing CS}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item Standing too far back. (14x, e.g. \logref{1:06}, \logref{1:20}).
\item Impatience, hit too early. (5x, e.g. \logref{3:22})
\item Drew creeps closer by taking Aggro, but didn't move in afterwards. (2x, \logref{2:30}  \logref{3:22})
\end{itemize}


\section{Itemisation}

\begin{remarks}
\goodremark{Starting items:
    Tangoes, Salve, 2 Branches to consume with Tango, Stout Shield}

\goodremark{Early Poor Man's Shield, Ring of Health}

\goodremark{Power Treads, Battle Fury}

\goodremark{Good item progression into Vladimir's Offering, Manta Style, Abyssal Blade.}

\badremark{Missed 2 opportunities to buy TP at sideshops when it was needed. (\logref{24:08}, crucial at \logref{41:10})}
\end{remarks}

\section{Mechanics}
\begin{remarks}
\badremark{ Toggle treads to Intelligence before using Blink (18 times, \logref{14:58} \logref{19:03} \logref{22:50}), especially early or when on low mana.}
\neutralremark{Slow TP from base - use the regeneration buff, loses a lasthit and 5 seconds.\logref{13:36}}
\neutralremark{Treadswitch to Strength when backing from tower. \logref{12:46}}
\neutralremark{Don't blink out of neutral camps before killing the last one -  loses 6 seconds. \logref{18:30}}
\neutralremark{Blink forward in the lane and move to cleave the ranged creep. \logref{22:54} \logref{22:58}}
\neutralremark{Blink as quickly as possible when you are moving. \logref{31:25} \logref{31:50}}
\end{remarks}

\section{Information \& Assessment}
\begin{remarks}
\neutralremark{ Didn't check inventory of lane opponent when arriving.}

\neutralremark{Didn't view the ganks of lane opponent - missing skill information.}

\badremark{Didn't check inventory of enemy entering the lane - didn't realise own advantage (3x) \logref{6:01}}

\badremark{Didn't notice damage output on creeps to infer skillpoint assignment and hero strength.\logref{10:40}}

\neutralremark{Could watch fights of team more, to get a better understanding of each hero's power.}
\end{remarks}


\section{Fighting}
\begin{remarks}
\goodremark{ Good blinks for solo kills on Omniknight and PL (\logref{19:00}, \logref{19:42})}
\goodremark{ Good solokill on Pudge (\logref{49:15})}

\neutralremark{Dangerous aggressive movement, but goes unpunished and creates pressure. (\logref{27:20}, \logref{28:40}, \logref{30:10}, \logref{30:50}) }
\neutralremark{Using ultimate for harassment damage without kill potential.}

\badremark{Using Ultimate into Blademail(\logref{31:00}).}
\badremark{Unnecessary deaths due to wrong escape path. Rather move towards your allies (\logref{24:50}), stay hidden in trees (\logref{37:28}) and don't corner yourself(\logref{52:50}).

\threeminimaps{img/death2450.pdf}{img/death3728.pdf}{img/death5250.pdf}}

\badremark{Unnecessary deaths for staying in lost fight (\logref{33:20}, \logref{47:40})}
\end{remarks}

\section{Movement}
\begin{remarks}

\neutralremark{Left fountain early, but then stayed in bad position behind tower. Rather move into jungle to have more vision. \logref{-0:35}
\minimap{img/pregame.pdf}}

\goodremark{ Switched lane in reaction to stubborn teammate. (\logref{0:50})}



\badremark{Missed opportunities to push the lane and create pressure (\logref{6:18} opponent dead,\logref{ 8:40} opponent shows somewhere else)}

\goodremark{ Went to fountain to heal at a good time \logref{13:05}}

\badremark{ Passive movement at\logref{14:55}, farming jungle instead of available lane.
\twominimaps{img/1455bad.pdf}{img/1455good.pdf}
           }


\neutralremark{ Inefficient farm movement at \logref{16:00}, missing out on 8 lane creeps.
\twominimaps{img/1600bad.pdf}{img/1600good.pdf}
           }

\neutralremark{ Didn't react to enemy, taking suboptimal movement at \logref{19:50}. Should notice Axe/Mirana mid at 19:54, turn and kill creepwave bottom, then take rune.

        \item Waited for next creepwave, delayed then pushed it.  \\

        \end{itemize}
    \end{minipage}
\end{center}
            }

\neutralremark{Inefficient farming movement at  \logref{28:52}. Can stack an additional camp, wrong camp order.

       }

\goodremark{ Good splitpush delaying the push.(\logref{37:10}, \logref{39:10}, \logref{44:50}, \logref{50:30})}
