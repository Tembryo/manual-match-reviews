Match context: Solo ranked AP.
Playing utility support - focus is on enabling the teams cores. Reached a strong individual position by contributing to fights without dying, setting up good fights with Song of the Siren. 


Summary:
= Good Itemisation. Aghanims Scepter with low impact, consider switching itembuild depending on enemy team.
+ Good awareness, viewing action and checking hero itemisation
+ Very impactful usage of Song of the Siren
= Efficiency improvements though stacking and TPs to fountain. 
- Frequent suboptimal use of Ensnare
- Missed out on opportunitites for deep wards, placing less effective ones 
- Expending all

Highlight tip:
.


Itemisation:
+ Good starting items, keeping gold for earlier Boots.
+ Rushed Arcane Boots
+ Progression into Mekansm
- Early Aghanims Scepter 
    No good usage of the additional healing effect. Good effectivity is unlikely: moderate AoE damage (Mirana Starstorm, OD ult is ususally killing), single target cores (OD/Drow).
    Ultimate used as initiation, consider buying Blink Dagger/Force Staff
    Considser Drums of Endurance
+ Luxuries: Glimmer Cape, Guardian Greaves

- Miss out on buying wards for first night (buy/send at 4:00)
- Unused ward in stash from 8:10 until 15:20
- Missed buying relevant TP scrolls at 25:50 (at sideshop), 27:15 (get 2nd TP in base)

Early game:

+ Effective initial laning to zone and kill offlaner Axe
+ Good movement mid to help Juggernaut against Mirana/OD
+ Regularly secure runes
- Missed stack of hardcamp at 1:00
    -> Draw the creeps to the left, or eat a different tree and draw them  up.   
- No wards for mid, lots of fighting
- Missed multiple stacks when moving around
    -> stack the medium camp above top rune at 2:00, 4:00, 8:00 before going for the rune.
    -> stack dire ancient camp at 9:00 when walking around bottom rune

Information:

+ Good camera control, saw most action on the map.
+ Active checking of heroes to track itemisation.

= Could use scoreboard more, to keep a better overview.
= Prioritised checking allies items over enemies, other way around is preferable.
= Could check even more inventories when looking at action. 1:28 3:07 3:13 6:37 8:38 11:17 11:19 11:23 18:30
= Sometimes bad camera position to view action 3:24 11:21 18:30

- No warding for mid during the first night (opportunity to place at 4:20)
- Unnecessary showing in top lane at 3:32, rather stay out of vision.
- Missed opportunity to place deep ward 10:40
[Minimap]
- Walking for unclear goal, should immediately go for wards 34:04
- Too defensive ward at 20:22

- Too defensive wards at 34:25

Mechanics:

+ Active control of Illusions
    -> Consider spreading them out in the later parts of the game. E.g. farm smallcamp with 2 at 21:14, spread to give m
    -> Keep the main hero moving while microing. Lost movement time at 17:46 21:30

= Walked close to trees, hit by arrow at 5:30

- Missed a few lasthits due to standing too far back  6:47 19:36 18:47 19:35 

- Position unnecessarily far back, during laning 5:11 6:40 (misses lasthit) 9:30 (misses exp).


Movement decisions:

+ Active movement around the map 

- Use TP scroll to return to base quickly 26:05, 31:05

- Inefficient movement from 20:10. Can farm radiant jungle or dire secret shop camp, instead of walking through jungle.

Fight Execution:

+ Presence in many fights, gaining assist Gold.
+ Close survival in multiple fights.
+ Good offensive use of Song of the Siren for initiation at 10:10 14:15 3023
+ Good use of Song of the Siren to save allies at 22:05 37:55

= Late TP out during Song when escaping from fight at 33:35 


- Frequent unnecessary use of Ensnare - wasting mana and putting it on cooldown:

    - 1:55 on Mirana, could maybe use it to prevent her from contesting the rune later.
    = 2:21 on Silencer, as he dies to towerhit (very close). Would get another kill later.
    - 3:30  on Axe, bad initiation as there is no way to kill him.
    - 12:50 on OD, too early for initiation. 
    - 23:22 on Axe, he is initiating and does not want to move. Missing mana for Rip Tide afterwards.
    - 25:55 on Axe, he is waiting for Euls to finish  and does not want to move.
    - 29:20 on Roshan.
    - 37:05 on Axe, he is farming a creepwave and does not want to move.
    - 38:31 on Drow, she will die to Omnislash. 

- Missed crucial Rip Tide at 10:17 casting too early before song ends. Loses a kill on Silencer.

- Too defensive positioning in fight at 19:05. Missed Rip Tide by standing too far 19:08. Could possibly get additional kill on Mirana by being closer and using Ensnare on Mirana instead of OD.

- Too defensive positioning in fight at 22:05. Instead move forward with Song and look for opportunities, as Axe is sure to die. 

- Missed Rip Tide at 25:57 after Illusions die too fast.

- Suboptimal Illusion usage at 30:23. Sent them to hit Axe, could instead send them forward to give more vision against Mirana's Ultimate as they carry gem.
