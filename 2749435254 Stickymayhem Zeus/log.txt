Skill build: 
!!maxed Static Field over Arc Lightning
!! no quickcast

start with bottle+clarity?

000 give last bottle charge to veno before taking rune

055 bolt? 
059 mechanics wasted mana on lasthit - can rightclick
104 mechanics missed deny
108 mechanics wasted mana on lasthit - can rightclick
117 mechanics missed deny
119 mechanics bad positioning - keeps lane pushed, tank creeps. stand below to pull them back
127 mechanics missed lasthit (no mana)
134 mechanics wasted mana on lasthit - can rightclick
146 mechanics missed lasthit (late, super close)
149 mechanics missed lasthit (impossible to tower - need to prehit +cast )
216 mechanics missed lasthit (to tower - need to prehit + cast)
218 mechanics missed lasthit (need to bottle+cast, not enough damage)
228 mechanics missed deny (unnecessary movement back)
235 mechanics missed deny (camera movement to check rune is late - )
249 mechanics missed deny (need to move forward with the creep)

257 information didn't check bottom before gank
301 decision bad gank bottom 
    no way to kill. lane is pushed, full HP, only ember spirit bola VS Timbersaw
    Overall not worth:
        missed 2 creepwaves
        got 300exp, 290 gold
        lost 530 exp, 390 gold

401 efficiency - find haste rune
    should use immediately, regen  up and take top rune
    could get 1 additional lasthit in mid

431 mechanics missed lasthit (backed too far - kunkka used abilities, its safe)
436 mechanics missed lasthit (unnecessary movement)
437 mechanics missed lasthit (unnecessary movement)
442 information didn't check top lane for gank (also would see pathing of WK)
456 execution wrong pathing for gank

506 decision stayed top - instead TP back mid
    got 200 exp, 160g (taken from BB/KotL)
    could instead get 

527 mechanics missed lasthit (used arc lightning on the wrong creep)

536 mechanics missed 2x lasthit (unnecessary movement)

617 decision inefficient chase for kunkka 
    (Reduced damage from Ship/ Rum buff, see when casting arc lightning)
    losing creepwave mid, 120g 180 exp
    expending ult, 340 mana!
    638 would kill timbersaw here with the mana (Bolt+Ult)

631 itemisation delayed using courier ()

646 decision inefficient rotation bottom
    - ember is farming the lane, don't want to take his gold/exp or push his lane
    - too early to push T2, no damage with Zeus/Ember / not worth pushing without supports
    instead go stack/then farm the jungle

707 mechanics missed lasthit (too early)
709 mechanics missed lasthit (too late, needed to arc lightning)
713 mechanics missed lasthit (left for ember)
718 mechanics missed lasthit (left for ember, didnt try when he misses)
727 mechanics missed lasthit (unnecessary movement)

822 Missed lasthit (unnecessary movement)
829 Missed lasthit (early)
852 Missed lasthit (left to Veno)
858 missed lasthit (didnt try with arc lightning?)

917 execution missed Kill on LC (unnecessary movement)
920 execution delayed kill/respawn of WK, letting him get off stun on Bristleback
    -> cast Lightning Bolt on the ground when enemies try  to juke (uphill)   

940 efficiency unnecessary bolt (nothing to hit)
941 efficiency suboptimal movement away from the lane  -> miss 2 lasthits as too far away
954 efficiency inefficient pathing to rune - can walk in the river

1020 missed lasthit (early)
1020 herobuild don't get 2 lasthits due to leveling Static Field over Arc Lightning 

1028 - 1044 herobuild less damage due to skilling Static Field over Arc Lightning 
    8x arc - 120 dmg

1053 efficiency missed TP top
    lost 11 creeps! 471 gold, ~800 Exp

1133 herobuild less damage due to skilling Static Field over Arc Lightning (save 2 autoattacks)

1156 herobuild less damage due to skilling Static Field over Arc Lightning (save 2 autoattacks)
1159 mechanics missed lasthit (move closer to next creep)

1232 herobuild less damage due to skilling Static Field over Arc Lightning (save 1 cast of arc lightning)
1232 efficiency unnecessary autoattack (hit the big one, saves one hit) 

1251 herobuild less damage due to skilling Static Field over Arc Lightning

1305 decision missed a kill on Timbersaw!
    Hit Bolt - Can follow up with Arc Lightning+Ultimate

1314 execution suboptimal cast order in gank  \\clip
    Ultimate to scout - dangerous position, enigma,  Black Hole possible
    Bolt, most damage+ give vision and prevent jukes
    then Arc Lightning

1344 execution missed lasthit (tried for 2 hits - use arc lightning)

1347 herobuild less damage due to skilling Static Field over Arc Lightning (save 2 autoattacks)
1352 execution missed lasthit (casted on wrong creep - prioritize the one hin by creepwave)
1355 execution missed lasthit (casted on wrong creep - prioritize the one hin by creepwave)
1358 execution missed lasthit (left wave early)

1405 decision !important movement to the wrong side of the map
    big creepwave on top is pushing in
        -farm than, push out (otherwise someone else has to rotate)
    no need to join the team bottom
        strong enough as 4
        too early to push highground
    long distance to walk, top is far closer
    safe position top
    can TP back to fountain after pushing and refill

1441 herobuild less damage due to skilling Static Field over Arc Lightning (gets one more lasthit instead of Venomancer)
1444 decision !dangerous position
    - low HP, LC missing 
    Use lighning bolt to give truesight in entire lane, sentry only covers the side

1518 decision stayed around trying to presure in bad position
    - nothing to gain
    go farm jungle, use mana from bloodstone
    or tp top to push

1519 decision !dangerous position
    - low HP, LC missing 

1544 execution casted too too many spells, lets LC catch up
    - turn twice for arc lightning
    - didn't cancel backswing of ultimate 

1600 decision missed buying TP scroll  (want to TP out at 1807) 

1618 mechanics missed lasthit (impatient/tried using one more arcane lightning, late due to no quickcast)
1618 herobuild less damage due to skilling Static Field over Arc Lightning (missed 2 lasthits, saves 1 arcane lightning)
1622 mechanics missed lasthit (hit early/misjudged damage)

1618 herobuild less damage due to skilling Static Field over Arc Lightning (missed 2 lasthits, saves 1 arcane lightning)

1654 execution didnt retreat correctly, dangerous position
    could get duelled at 1656
        could die to Kunkka/Timbersaw/Enigma followup, rum buff saves enemy team
    ran into bristleback and got bodyblocked
    turned twice to cast spells


1700 herobuild less damage due to skilling Static Field over Arc Lightning (timbersaw dies 1 arcane lightning earlier)

1707 mechanics missed lasthit (veno got it, use arcane lightning)
1708 execution didn't cast arcane lightning on creep (better than hitting tower) 

1749 execution unnecessary walking back
    - not focused by anyone
    - bolt ready in 1 second

1806 decision walk into dangerous situation
    - alone/ember spirit is almost dead
    - no escape 
    - kill on Timbersaw is not worth dying
    TP out instead (if had TP)

1845 efficiency/decision suboptimal walk to rune
    farm/stack medium camp mid instead
    bottle is full! 

1901 mechanics almost missed lasthit(used arc lightning on wrong creep) 
1918 herobuild less damage, less bounces due to skilling Static Field over Arc Lightning (missed 3 creep lasthits+ 4 eidolons, saves 1 arcane lightning)
1906 mechanics missed lasthit (arcane lightning early, or move in to rightclick. get it with different skillbuild)
1907 mechanics missed lasthit (arcane lightning early, or move in to rightclick. get it with different skillbuild)
1910 mechanics missed lasthit (arcane lightning early/on the eidolons. get it with different skillbuild)

1917 efficiency unnecessary movement forward/backward, delays multiple uses of arc lightning! 
    - mouse positioning for cast takes time

1927 decision suboptimal staying in midlane, slightly dangerous position
    alone, far forward - could get dangerous with X mark, Duel...
    instead move into jungle/bottom

2008 mechanics missed lasthit (casted on wrong creep)
2013 mechanics missed lasthit (casted on wrong creep)
2023 mechanics missed lasthit (ignored catapult)
2029 decision/itemisation missed opportunity to buy TP scroll at side shop
2030 efficiency suboptimal movemnt to rune
    walk through the jungle, farm hard camp on the way

2112 herobuild less damage due to skilling Static Field over Arc Lightning (miss 1 lasthit)
2112 mechanics missed lasthit (casted early)
2116 decision bad highground push
    - too early
    - 4v5, veno is walking towards base
    - ultimate on cooldown
    take enemy jungle instead, take top T2

2133 execution standing a bit too close to team
    - caught in black hole, can otherwise cancel and win the fight


2234 mechanics missed lasthit (unnecessary movement, late on the cast due to turn rate)
2235 herobuild less damage, less bounces due to skilling Static Field over Arc Lightning (missed 2 creep lasthits)
2236 mechanics missed lasthit (standing too far)
2236 mechanics missed lasthit (unnecessary movement, late on the cast due to turn rate)

2250 decision dangerous movement through enemy jungle
    -could get caught by duel (possibly with followup)
    -dangerous path, possibly warded
    instead walk back the lane, farm hardcamp

2323 mechanics missed lasthit (use arc lightning)

2355 decision suboptimal/dangerous movement - walking away from rune, to ancient camp
    - instead stay at the rune to immediately pick it up. 6 seconds delay
    4 enemies missing, could run into multiple farming hard/ancient camp


2408 efficiency suboptimal movement, walking to hardcamp
    instead farm fight side of jungle (medium/easy/hard camp, farm bottom)

2440 efficiency use blink dagger to move
2450 mechanics missed lasthit (wrong creep, aggroed by catapult)
2457 mechanics missed lasthit (ignored catapult, too far)
2510 execution weird chasing angle
2511 execution bad blink
    - separated from the fight if enemies move down
    2514 didnt cast arc lightning
    2517 moved out, let the timbersaw escape

2545 decision! bad cast of lightning bolt
    - cast too far, walk back
    - blink dagger still on cooldown, should wait for that

2646 efficiency didn't use blink dagger to move (miss 2 lasthits)
2656 mechanics missed lasthit (too far, didnt blink)
2658 mechanics missed lasthit (too late on the bold, didnt blink earlier)
2706 mechanics missed lasthit (didn't move in to rightclick)
2734 mechanics missed lasthit (didn't move in to rightclick)
2736 decision missed opportunity to buy TP 
2804 mechanics missed lasthit (unnecessary movement/ moved camera)

2818 decision dangerous movement 
    - no vision, likely to be warded

2847 mechanics missed lasthit 2x (1 didnt rightclick, 2nd didn't prehit before casts )
2849 decision dangerous push
    alone, kunkka/WK/enigma missing
    don't deal tower damage with zeus

2857 execution didn't use spells as quickly as possible
    2857 should use ult to scout, get ult off for the fight at rosh in case of chainstun 
    2903 after bolt immediately use arc lightning
    2910 ran with arc lightning off cooldown 

2915 information didn't watch teamfight at rosh (see that enigma is really low HP)
2915 efficiency didn't use blink dagger to move
    could kill enigma! 

2940 efficiency bad walk to secretshop
    use courier for that!
    bring out TP!
    instead farm the jungle, can farm 2-3 camps in this time

3008 efficiency didn't farm hardcamp on the way
3028 mechanics missed lasthit (didn't move in to rightclick)
3045 efficiency late use of blink dagger to move (8 seconds, misses 1 lasthit at 31:02) 
3046 efficiency suboptimal pathing (don't walk down into the river)
    takes longer
    dangerous as no vision

3138 mechanics missed lasthit (microing illusions)
3142 mechanics missed lasthit (late)
3146 mechanics missed lasthit (stood too far away)
3153 mechanics missed lasthit (stood too far away)
3202 mechanics missed lasthit (stood too far away)

3227 decision dangerous position, walk too close to base
    kunkka has X-Mark, only Keeper as backup

3253 execution turned late, use lightning bolt when WK switches target
    - spend time moving camera to move down
    - instead walk into trees, keep camera still

3302 execution unnecessary movement
    -delayes arc lighning on creeps, just stand

3313 execution missed lasthit (late arc lightning)
3317 execution missed lasthit (blinked out unnecessarily, then too far)

3347 decision !important walked into enemies
    walking highground!
    saw them move in, chasing the ember
    - instead use Lightning Bolt to scout the highground

3322 decision 

3342 efficiency tabbed out too long, standing in base for 17 seconds after respawn

3547 execution missed lasthit (arcane lightning too early)
3550 execution missed lasthit (didnt rightclick /cast on wrong creep)
3551 execution missed lasthit (wrong creep, late due to turn)

3600 decision dangerous path
    LC/WK missing
    instead walk back and through the other entrance

3604 decision dangerous walking highground
    use lightning bolt to scout!

3610 decision !important show position by casting spell
    alone in dangerous position
    causes WK to chase

3619 decision escape in wrong direction
    - ran left, saw enigma with Ultimate
    instead run down, toward Keeper

3808 efficiency unnecessary hit on small creep in camp
3823 mechanics missed lasthit (didnt walk close)
3827 mechanics missed lasthit (didnt rightclick)

4027 mechanics missed lasthit (use lightning bolt)
4148 efficicency let regeneration rune get cancelled by creeps
    use it earlier e.g. immeediately after picking it up at 4127
    or: dont blink up into creepwave 

4222 execution didn't use arc lightning (can get 2 onto LC, might kill)

4431 execution missed lasthit (casted on wrong creep)

4556 execution wrong cast order 
    use arc lightning first, higher cast range
    will get off cooldown earlier, one additional cast

4626 decision bad blink forward
    - no vision, wk missing
    - front of the fight, want to stay at the side

4756 efficiency didn't use blink to move

4824 decision didnt use ult to scout
    - as reaction to initiation by kunkka

4943 efficiency didn't use blink to move (6 seconds late)
    -blink into enemy vision at 4949

    wait until blink is off cooldown/ somebody else is focused

5520 mechanics missed lasthit (didnt rightclick)
5523 mechanics missed lasthit (casted early)
5529 mechanics missed lasthit (didnt rightclick)
