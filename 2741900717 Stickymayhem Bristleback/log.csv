"102","Mechanics","Missed deny"
"109","Mechanics","Missed lasthit (stood too far, am can deny)"

"113","Decision","Missed good opportunity for sidepull (the hard camp). PL isn’t contesting, lane is pushed"
"119","Execution","Drew tower aggro, didn’t shift it off after (dont rightclick the AM immediately, walk close first. Deny click a creep to drop aggro)"

"645","Efficiency","Unnecessary TP to lane (save the gold, Weaver can keep the lane solo, )"
"736","Mechanics","Unnecessary tower damage"

"912","Information","Important! Bad Camera movement! Miss pathing of enemies, lets PL escape"
